Simple memory made to practice React concepts and features. The app keeps track of your current score and your best score. 

It also uses the original 151 Pokemon as assets. However, only 12 are used at a time bc a memory game with 151 cards is too hard and can't fit on a screen. Hence, The app picks a random 12 Pokemon on load/refresh.
